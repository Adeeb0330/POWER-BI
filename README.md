# 📊 Survey Data Analysis | Power BI  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing survey data using **Power BI** to uncover meaningful insights. The dataset was processed using **Power Query** to ensure normalization and schema consistency. An interactive **Power BI dashboard** was developed with **DAX-powered custom measures, calculated columns, and drill-through filters** for deeper analysis.  

## 🚀 Key Features  
- ✅ **Data Cleaning & Transformation:** Used Power Query for preprocessing and schema consistency.  
- ✅ **Interactive Dashboard:** Implemented filters, slicers, and drill-through functionality.  
- ✅ **DAX Calculations:** Created custom measures and calculated columns for advanced insights.  
- ✅ **Visualization:** Built interactive charts, graphs, and KPIs for a user-friendly experience.
